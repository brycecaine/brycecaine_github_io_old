            Scout Charter is a web app I created in Django, Bootstrap, JQuery, and PostgreSQL that helps our local scouting unit manage advancement information. It deliberately seeks to provide a simple interface for leaders and scouts.

            Read It Down is a web app I created for a local middle school to track minutes students have read. Due to my limited side-job time though, the school decided to go another direction. I still have hopes for developing it further and providing it as a service to anyone wanting to use it.
